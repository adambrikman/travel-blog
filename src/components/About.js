            <p>Welcome to my travel blog! My name is Adam and I fell in love with traveling in 2017. It was in March of 2017 that I looked back on my life and asked myself 'Why am I working?' After taking a while to think about it, I had come to realize that I was simply working to save for my future. There's nothing wrong with that but I also noticed that I had never really spent my money on leisure activities. As such, I was just stressing about my work schedule or my day-to-day life and never taking a break to unwind. That's when I decided it was time to try taking a 'vacation.'</p>

            <p>I ended up taking a three-week trip to Europe! I explored nine cities, which were: London, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, Florence, Cinque Terre, Venice and Interlaken! After the trip, I realized how much I was missing out on life. Since then I've commited to continue traveling, whethere it be domestic or international.</p>

            <p>On this blog, you'll catch a few of my trip stories as well as tips and tricks that I've learned while traveling!</p>
